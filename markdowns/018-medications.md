# Medications

The collection of medication information in the Human Phenotype Project study relies on self-reporting of medication usage via online and smartphone applications, as well as collection by staff members through telephone or face-to-face interviews during follow-up.

Self-reporting occurs when participants disclose their medication use to researchers. Having accurate and complete data on medication usage is essential for understanding the true impact of these medications on individuals' health. 

### Data availability:

- During registration (sign-up) for the study, participants are asked to report their regular medications online, with an autofill feature, selecting from a predefined drop-down list.
- During follow-up calls or visits, participants update their medication intake.
- App medication logging.

All three sources of data are stored in 1 parquet file: `medications.parquet`
