# UKBB Followup Questionnaire

This lifestyle questionnaire is an adaptation of the UK Biobank touch screen questionnaire.
The full version is sent to the participants via email and is completed online by them in the Zoho platform, prior or after the baseline visit. The short, followup, questionnaire version is filled by the participants in followup visits. 
Questions asked are related to the participantâ€™s lifestyle and demographics, physical activity, use of cellular phone, diet and eating habits, sleep, smoking and alcohol consumption, family and medical history. The short follow-up version contains only part of the baseline survey, and includes two additional sections; 11 questions from the Minnesota Living With Heart failure questionnaire
Some of the questions have been adapted to account for cultural differences in Israel compared to the UK.
