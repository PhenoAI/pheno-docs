# Diet logging dataset  

Diet logging through a smartphone app encompasses the detailed recording of food and beverage intake. This includes specifics such as the varieties of food consumed, portion sizes, nutritional components, and the timing of meals. By tracking these dietary patterns, individuals can monitor their own eating habits, while researchers can use the aggregated data to gain valuable insights into broader dietary trends within a population. Furthermore, this information can be correlated with other time-based measurements and occurrences to yield a more comprehensive understanding of health and nutrition.

### Data availability:
The information is stored in 3 parquet files: `diet_logging.parquet`, `diet_logging_events.parquet`,  `raw_diet_logging_events.parquet `which contains a summary table, processed and raw diet logging data respectively.
