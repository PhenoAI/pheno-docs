# Body composition (DXA) dataset  

Body composition was profiled based on DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging, and includes measurements of fat and lean mass for the legs, arms, trunk, gynoid, and android, as well as measurements of total scan visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area, mass and volume are included.

DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) is a medical imaging technique that is used to measure body composition, specifically the amounts of bone, fat, and lean muscle tissue in the body. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, which is then analyzed by a software to determine the body composition. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring body composition, as it is able to distinguish between different types of tissue and provide detailed information about the distribution of fat and muscle in the body. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing bone density and for monitoring changes in body composition over time, such as during weight loss, muscle building programs or for assessment of sarcopenia.
