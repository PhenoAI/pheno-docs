# Medical procedures

The Human Phenotype Project study gathers medical data through online surveys where participants self-report their use of medical procedures. This approach relies on individuals to communicate their experiences with medical interventions. Accurate and comprehensive information about the utilization of these procedures is crucial for grasping their actual effects on personal health.

### Data availability:

During the registration phase of the study, participants are required to provide details about their medical procedures in the Initial Medical Survey. Further data is then gathered in the Follow-up Medical Survey when participants return for subsequent visits.

The information is stored in 2 parquets file: `initial_medical.parquet`, `follow_up_medical.parquet`
