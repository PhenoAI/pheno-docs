# Blood pressure dataset  
Blood pressure is the measurement of the force exerted against the walls of the arteries as blood flows through them. Blood pressure is recorded as two values: systolic pressure (the pressure when the heart beats) and diastolic pressure (the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats).

Blood pressure measurement can be performed in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and even at home, using an automated or manual sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure measurement can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment interventions, such as lifestyle changes. The goal of treatment is to achieve and maintain target blood pressure levels, which are generally lower for individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. 

Blood pressure is measured using an OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-RML31 device and an appropriately sized cuff. Multiple blood pressure readings are done during the visit. For each blood pressure reading, three measurements are taken: systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and average heart rate. The participant is asked to avoid caffeine, exercise and smoking at least 30 minutes before the measurement. The measurement is taken on the left arm if possible.
