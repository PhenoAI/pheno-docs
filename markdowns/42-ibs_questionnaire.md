# IBS servey

This IBS survey is an adaptation of the UK Biobank online gastro-intestinal health self-assessment questionnaire. Many of the questions in the UK Biobank gut health (IBS) questionnaire were adopted from the World Gastroenterology Association questionnaire (2009).
Questions asked are related to the participantâ€™s bowel habits, characterization of abdominal pain patterns, accompanying symptoms, and history of IBS in the family.
