# Fundus images dataset  

Fundus imaging allows for the visualization of the interior surface of the eye, known as the fundus; and used to examine structures such as the optic disc, retina, and retinal microvasculature. This procedure is commonly used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye diseases.

Fundus imaging is a type of medical imaging technique that is used to obtain detailed, high-resolution images of the back of the eye, including the retina, the optic nerve, and the macula, an oval-shaped area in the center of the retina used for central vision (Figure 1). These images can provide important information about the health of the eye and can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye diseases and conditions.

One of the key features that can be seen in fundus images is the retinal microvasculature, which refers to the network of small blood vessels that supply blood to the retina. The appearance and structure of the retinal microvasculature can provide information about the health of the eye and can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of conditions.

In addition, the information provided by fundus imaging can also be used in research to better understand the underlying mechanisms of various eye conditions and as a non-invasive tool for visualization of the general microvascular circulation health and a direct view to part of the central nervous system. As such, the fundus image can serve as a window to systemic health. 

The Human Phenotype Project (HPP) performs fundus imaging on each participant's eyes to produce image files. To process and enhance the data, an open source software pipeline: AutoMorph: Automated Retinal Vascular Morphology Quantification via a Deep Learning Pipeline (Zhou 2022), that combines several different deep learning models is used. Specifically for the following steps:
(1) Image pre-processing.
(2) Image quality grading.
(3) Anatomical segmentation (binary vessel segmentation, artery/vein segmentation, and optic disc segmentation).
(4) Various morphological feature measurements such as vessel caliber, tortuosity density, fractal dimension etc. These features were calculated separately for segmented veins and arteries, and also as a combined feature.
The current pipeline does not include automatic identification or clinical interpretation of eye abnormalities such as age-macular degeneration (AMD) or edema, glaucoma signs, microaneurysms etcâ€™ that can be derived from the fundus image.

### Data availability:
- All tabular information is stored in a main parquet file: `fundus.parquet`
- Image files including segmentations are stored in subfolders and mapped in the main parqet file.
