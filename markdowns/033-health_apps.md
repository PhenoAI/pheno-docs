# Health Apps Dataset
Smartphone apps and wearables have become vital for monitoring health behaviors in real-world settings, providing rich data for research. As part of the Human Phenotype Project (HPP), we gather health and wellness data from Google Fit and Apple HealthKit.

Google Fit was launched in October 2014, Google Fit is an open platform supporting Android 4.1 and above, collecting user data through wearables and self-reporting, with metrics on physical activity and more.

Apple HealthKit was introduced with iOS 8+, Apple HealthKit aggregates data from the Apple Watch and self-reports via the Health app, covering physical activity, heart rate, and sleep metrics.

These datasets offer insights into daily health behaviors, enabling clinical research to observe lifestyle impacts, medication adherence, and intervention effects in natural settings. Continuous, real-world data can enhance predictive models and uncover correlations often missed in clinical studies.
