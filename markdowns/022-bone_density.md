# Bone size, mineral and density (DXA) dataset  

Bone density was profiled based on DXA imaging, and includes measurements of mineral content in different parts of a variety of skeletal components.

DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging is a method used to measure bone density and mineral content. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, specifically the bones. The scan is then analyzed by a software to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in different parts of the body. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring bone density, as it is able to provide detailed information about the distribution of bone mineral content in different bony structures of the body skeleton. The spine and hip are most commonly measured because that is where most osteoporotic fractures occur. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing the risk of osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone density and increased risk of fractures, and for monitoring the effects of treatments for the condition.
