## Paper summary

                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>
                <jats:p>Dietary modifications are crucial for managing newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and preventing its health complications, but many patients fail to achieve clinical goals with diet alone. We sought to evaluate the clinical effects of a personalized postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet on glycemic control and metabolic health in individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM as compared to the commonly recommended Mediterranean-style (MED) diet.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>
                <jats:p>We enrolled 23 adults with newly diagnosed T2DM (aged 53.5 ± 8.9 years, 48% males) for a randomized crossover trial of two 2-week-long dietary interventions. Participants were blinded to their assignment to one of the two sequence groups: either PPT-MED or MED-PPT diets. The PPT diet relies on a machine learning algorithm that integrates clinical and microbiome features to predict personal postprandial glucose responses (PPGR). We further evaluated the long-term effects of PPT diet on glycemic control and metabolic health by an additional 6-month PPT intervention (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 16). Participants were connected to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) throughout the study and self-recorded dietary intake using a smartphone application.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>
                <jats:p>In the crossover intervention, the PPT diet lead to significant lower levels of CGM-based measures as compared to the MED diet, including average PPGR (mean difference between diets, − 19.8 ± 16.3 mg/dl × h, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), mean glucose (mean difference between diets, − 7.8 ± 5.5 mg/dl, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), and daily time of glucose levels &gt; 140 mg/dl (mean difference between diets, − 2.42 ± 1.7 h/day, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). Blood fructosamine also decreased significantly more during PPT compared to MED intervention (mean change difference between diets, − 16.4 ± 37 μmol/dl, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.0001). At the end of 6 months, the PPT intervention leads to significant improvements in multiple metabolic health parameters, among them HbA1c (mean ± SD, − 0.39 ± 0.48%, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001), fasting glucose (− 16.4 ± 24.2 mg/dl, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.02) and triglycerides (− 49 ± 46 mg/dl, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). Importantly, 61% of the participants exhibited diabetes remission, as measured by HbA1c &lt; 6.5%. Finally, some clinical improvements were significantly associated with gut microbiome changes per person.</jats:p>

                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>
                <jats:p>In this crossover trial in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM, a PPT diet improved CGM-based glycemic measures significantly more than a Mediterranean-style MED diet. Additional 6-month PPT intervention further improved glycemic control and metabolic health parameters, supporting the clinical efficacy of this approach.</jats:p>
