    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Sex-specific factors refer to biological and physiological differences, such as reproductive health, hormonal variations, disease prevalence and aging processes that influence medical health outcomes in males and females.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes sex-specifc factors, captured through mutiple surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement protocol \n",
    "<!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->\n",
    "The lifestyle surveys (ukbb and follow-up ukbb) are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data availability \n",
    "<!-- for the example notebooks -->\n",
    "The information is stored in 5 parquet files: `menstrual_cycle`, `initial_medical.parquet`, `follow_up_medical.parquet`, `ukbb.parquet` and `follow_up_ukbb.parquet` which indicate the different sources where information is collected from.\n",
    "\n",
