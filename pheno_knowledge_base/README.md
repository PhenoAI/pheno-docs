The Human Phenotype Project is a landmark effort to empower researchers to make the next breakthroughs in human health. By profiling a diverse participant base of individuals beyond the genome, and incorporating a wealth of now-measurable data layers and environmental influences, ‘deep phenotyping’ gathers the details of human health and disease. This novel approach brings together many pieces of the puzzle and builds a high-resolution view of the key drivers behind health and disease. Following in the wake of the Human Genome Project, The Human Phenotype Project will impact the way we approach and treat a wide range of diseases that plague human health.

The Human Phenotype Project’s proprietary datasets are already yielding insights that are advancing science and driving innovation across the pharmaceutical, healthcare, and life-sciences industries. As pharmaceutical R&D becomes increasingly data-driven, a top pharmaceutical company is using the project's data to transform it’s drug development programs. A prominent US-based life-sciences company is also using the data to engineer novel products to treat obesity, type 2 diabetes & other cardiometabolic diseases.

To achieve its mission to deeply phenotype over 100,000 participants from across the globe, The Human Phenotype Project is now partnering with leading international research institutions and is currently open to additional partners who wish to join
