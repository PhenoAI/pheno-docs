# Using Trusted Research Environment

## Launching a new Research Environment

A user can select a Study or multiple Studies and launch a Workspace to access and analyze data. To launch a Research Environment, follow these steps:

1. In the portal navigate to the **Studies** page using the menu on the left.
1. Select the Studies `MBZUAI Hackathon` and `Group {id} Shared Folder` to be attached to the new Workspace.
1. Once you have selected all the Studies you want, click the **Next** button.

4. Choose the type of Workspace you want and click the **Next** button.

![](platform_imgs/select_compute.png)

5. Use this format for the Workspace **Name** field: `group{id}-{full_name}-workspace{num}`. 
    
    Example: `group3-hagai_rossman-workspace1`.

5. Select `MBZUAI_DATA` in the **Project ID** drop down field.
5. Select the **Configuration** type - `Pheno-JupyterNotebook1GPU` or `Pheno-JupyterNotebook4GPU` according to your needs.
8. Type a description for the Workspace in the **Description** field.
9. Click the **Create Research Workspace** button.

This will deploy the new Workspace and attach the Studies that were selected. 

You will automatically be redirected to the Workspaces tab on the portal.

Wait for the workspace to be **Available**.

## Connecting to an Existing Research Environment

1. In the portal navigate to the **Workspaces** page using the menu on the left.
1. Click on the **Connections** button, below the **Workspace** name.

## Attach Files to a Research Environment

1. Navigate to the **Studies** page using the menu on the left.
1. Find the Study named `Group {id} Shared Folder` on the list and click **Upload Files** on the right.
1. You can upload files either by dragging and dropping, or by clicking the **Upload Files** or **Upload Folder** button.

## Collaborating and Sharing Data Between Environments

To work on the same code as your group, make sure you have included and selected your “Group X Shared Folder” study when creating your workspace. Inside the workspace, the shared folder will be located at `/home/ec2-user/studies/group_x`. In Jupyter’s file explorer, this will be under `studies/group_x`. All files and code included in this folder will be shared with your group (and only group members will have access to it). When saving code and temporary data, we recommend saving code in outside of the studies folder, and only move them to the shared folder once you’de like to share amongst your peers. 

## Terminating a Research Environment

When you no longer need a Research Environment you can terminate it. Follow these steps:

1. In the portal navigate to the **Workspaces** page using the menu on the left.
1. In the list of Workspaces, find the Workspace that you want to terminate.
1. Click on the **Terminate** button, the Workspace must be in the **Ready** state to terminate it.
