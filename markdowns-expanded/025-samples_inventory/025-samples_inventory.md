# Samples inventory dataset  

### Description 

The 10K samples inventory contains detailed information regarding all biological samples acquired as part of the 10K study.

### Introduction

Biological samples are collected and stored as part of the 10K study. These samples are used for the profiling of different systems and materials, such as human genetics, microbiome, metabolomics etc.
As new molecular profiling technologies evolve, it is essential to have access to historic samples of individuals for which additional wide profiling and longitudinal follow up exists. Thus, the availability of the biobanked samples represents a major opportunity.
Internally, information regarding the labeling and availability of samples are managed through the LabCollector software tool.

### Measurment protocol 
<!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->
The following samples are collected during the visits to the assessment center:
1. A total of 16cc of blood is collected in 3 tubes:
    1. CPT [Cellular Preparation Tubes] (8ml) - used for PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell) collection
Future plans include extracting and storing plasma from these samples, which may allow measuring cell free DNA, which is highly relevant for disease detection.
    2. Serum (5ml) 
    3. CBC (Complete Blood Count) (3ml). Material from these tubes is used and stored
2. Buccal swab for human DNA. Samples are sent to GenCov and are not stored. Measuring the oral microbiome from these samples is far from ideal, according to previous experiments done in the lab.

Stool samples are collected at home by participants using the DNA Genotek OM-200 kit. 
Tubes are barcoded and are registered to the LabCollector database upon scanning by the assessment center staff.
