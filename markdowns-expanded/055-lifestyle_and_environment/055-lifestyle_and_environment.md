### Introduction

The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes lifestyle and enviroment data, captured through two lifestyle surveys.

### Measurment protocol <!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->

These lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits. 

### Data availability <!-- for the example notebooks -->

The information is stored in 1 parquet file: `'lifestyle_and_environment.parquet'.
