# Sex-specifc factors dataset

### Description 

### Introduction

The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes sex-specifc factors, captured through mutiple surveys.

### Measurment protocol <!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->

The lifestyle surveys (ukbb and follow-up ukbb) are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits. 

### Data availability <!-- for the example notebooks -->

The information is stored in 5 parquet files: `menstrual_cycle`, `initial_medical.parquet`, `follow_up_medical.parquet`, `ukbb.parquet` and `follow_up_ukbb.parquet` which indicate the different sources where information is collected from.
