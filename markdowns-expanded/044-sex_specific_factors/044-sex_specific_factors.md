# Sex-specifc factors dataset

### Description

Sex-specific factors refer to biological and physiological differences, such as reproductive health, hormonal variations, disease prevalence and aging processes that influence medical health outcomes in males and females.

### Introduction

The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes sex-specifc factors, captured through mutiple surveys.

### Measurement protocol 
<!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->
The lifestyle surveys (ukbb and follow-up ukbb) are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits. 

### Data availability
