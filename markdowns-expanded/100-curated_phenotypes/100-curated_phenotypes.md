### Introduction

* Abdominal Adiposity: Increased abdominal obesity is a hallmark of fat or adiposity-related metabolic dysfunction.
* ADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, often persists into adulthood.
* Anxiety: People with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.
* BMI and Obesity: Overweight and obesity are associated with morbidity and mortality can lead to significant social and psychological challenges for individuals, including stigma, discrimination, and increased risk of mental health issues such as depression and low self-esteem.
* CKD: Chronic Kidney Disease includes a range of pathophysiologic processes associated with abnormal kidney function and a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
* Depression: Depression is a constellation of symptoms and signs that may include depressed mood.
* Diabetes: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a health condition characterized by blood sugar levels that are higher than normal, whereas in prediabetes blood sugar levels are not high enough yet to be classified as T2D.
* Endometriosis:  Endometriosis is a gynecological disease defined as endometrial glands and stroma that occur outside the uterine cavity.
* Hyperlipidemia: Lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and proteins that are essential for transport of cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), and fat-soluble vitamins in the blood. Disorders of lipoprotein metabolism include primary and secondary conditions that substantially increase or decrease specific circulating lipids (e.g., cholesterol or TGs) or lipoproteins (e.g., low density or high density lipoproteins).
* Hypertension: Hypertension is the most common reason for office visits and for the use of chronic prescription medications. Roughly one-half of hypertensive individuals do not have adequate blood pressure control.
* Ischemic Heart Disease: Ischemic heart disease (IHD), also referred to as coronary heart disease (CHD), is the term associated with an inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries, usually from atherosclerosis.
* MAFLD: Metabolic (dysfunction) Associated Fatty Liver Disease / Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) was described as an excessive fat infiltration of the liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption or other causes of liver disease.
* Menopause: Natural menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, determined retrospectively after a woman has experienced 12 months of amenorrhea without any other obvious pathologic or physiologic cause.
* Migraine: Migraine is an episodic disorder that manifests in a severe headache generally associated with nausea and/or light and sound sensitivity.
* NMSC: Nonmelanoma Skin Cancers are a group of cancers that arise from the skin but do not include melanoma. The most common types of nonmelanoma skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
* OSA: Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a disorder that is characterized by obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and/or respiratory effort-related arousals caused by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep.
* Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass, microarchitectural disruption, and skeletal fragility, resulting in decreased bone strength and an increased risk of fracture.
* Sarcopenia: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength, and performance.
* Sleep Quality: Sleep is considered a restorative process that allows for energy renewal and also for cellular. Low sleep quality may lead to accelerated aging by triggering DNA damage and chronic inflammation to influence the compensatory/resiliency systems of the human body.
